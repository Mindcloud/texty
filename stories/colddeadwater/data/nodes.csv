A desk made of old tires and plywood is set up nearby. Up the path to the <em>east</em> is a lookout tower. To the <em>west</em> lies a group of ramshackle buildings used to store food and munitions. To the <em>south</em> is a large green medical tent. Finally, to the <em>north</em> is a group of tents housing survivors, those too weak to pick up a gun and fight.
